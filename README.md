# PhoneCallKeywordDetector
The PhoneCallKeywordDetector application is a tool designed for analyzing phone call recordings and detecting specific keywords in each call. Given a directory of recordings, it transcribes the audio to text, searches for occurrences of a specified word, and provides timestamps for when the word appears in the call.
